# aidar - Reading AIDA files into R

This package allows to read histograms and tuples from <a href="http://aida.freehep.org/">AIDA</a> files.

The various objects from the file will be converted into R's dataframes. 


## Installing the development version of aidar from github:

(from <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9656016/how-to-install-development-version-of-r-packages-github-repository>)

	install.packages("devtools")
	library(devtools)
	
	dev_mode(on=T) # switch to development mode 
	install_github("aidar", username="apfeiffer1")
	
	# use dev ggplot2 now
	
	# when finished do:
	dev_mode(on=F)      # ... and you are back to having stable ggplot2
	
## Examples of usage

First set up access to the file, here we use a gzip compressed XML file in the package:

	histoFile = system.file("inst", "data", "histos.xml.gz", package="aidar")

We can list the content of the file via:

	getFileInfo(histoFile)

Now we can get the annotation of the object with the name "1" from the file:

	a1 = getAnnotation(histoFile, '1')
	
And that's how we get the (content of the) 1D histogram named '1' in the file into a R data-frame:

	h1 = getHisto1D(histoFile, '1')
	

Similar for a tuple named '100' in the gzip-compressed XML file:
	
	tupleFile = system.file("inst", "data", "tuple.xml.gz", package="aidar")
	aTup = getAnnotation(tupleFile, '100')
	
	t100 = getTuple(tupleFile, '100')
